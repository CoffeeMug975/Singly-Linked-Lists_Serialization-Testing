**Overview**<br>
This project implements a **singly linked list** abstract data type (ADT) in **C#**. The linked list supports various operations such as:
* Prepending 
* Appending
* Inserting 
* Removing
* Reversing items<br>

It also includes functionality for **serializing** and **deserializing** the linked list using DataContractSerializer. The project includes unit tests using the **NUnit framework** to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
